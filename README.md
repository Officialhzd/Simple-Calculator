# Python GUI Calculator

A simple calculator built with Python using a graphical user interface (GUI) powered by Tkinter.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- GUI with responsive buttons and a display
- Handles invalid input and division by zero
- Modular code: core logic separated from GUI

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-gui-calculator.git
   cd python-gui-calculator
   
2. Run the calculator:

  python gui.py

## File Structure

├── functions.py  # Core math functions and tokenizer
├── main.py       # CLI version of the calculator
├── gui.py        # Tkinter-based graphical interface
└── README.md

## Requirements
Python 3.x (No external libraries needed)

## Future Improvements
-- Add support for parentheses and complex expressions

-- Improve GUI design with themes
